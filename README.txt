In this project I implemented GPU code by writing a vertex shader. The vertex data is processed in phong.vert and the resulting color from the Phong Reflection Model is passed to phong.frag to set the final color. The result is an extremely realistic looking reflection model. Pictures of the rendering can be found in .png files capsule1-capsule4 and show the many advantages to using this model when programatically creating reflectance.
